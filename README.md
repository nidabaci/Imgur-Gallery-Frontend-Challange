## Imgur Gallery Challange

### Introduction
This project is a responsive web application that consumes the Imgur API to display gallery images in a grid of thumbnails. The user can select the gallery section from hot, top, and user, and can include or exclude viral images from the result set. Additionally, the user can specify window and sort parameters. 

When a user clicks on an image, the application shows its details such as the big image, title, description, upvotes, downvotes, score and much more. The Imgur API documentation was consulted to develop this project. It also has pagination.
